## The Problem

Given only its genomic sequence, how do we tell whether a pathogen is going to be dangerous or not?

This is one of the central problems of **using genomic surveillance for pathogen risk assessment**.

## How it's done now

1. Look for known mutations that are experimentally tested to enhance some pathogenesis-related phenotype.
2. Experimentally try to evolove those mutations in the lab.
3. Expert panel of *opinions*. (reference: CDC **I**nfluenza **R**isk **A**ssessment **T**ool)

## How it should be done

1. Objective measures of pathogenesis.
2. Standardized, safe, and scalable biochemical measurements to map genotype to phenotype.
3. Measurements done on both host *and* pathogen.

Focus today: pathogen side.
